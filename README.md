# BlackJack Card Game

This project was created using React and Javascript. Currently not supported for phone sized screen, but coming up! :)

## The Game:
A simple game of BlackJack. You will play against the computer. 
Usual BlackJack rules apply: whoever reaches 21 first, or gets closest to 21 wins. 

If you go over 21 you "bust" and lose automatically.

The first ace can count as either 1 or 11; whichever helps the player more.


Have fun :) 

## TODO
 - might add soft 17 optionality later; update graphics

 - make cards overlap
 - update phone size support
 - add a high score list
