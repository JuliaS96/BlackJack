# BlackJack Card Game

This project was created using React and Javascript.

## The Game:
A simple game of BlackJack. You will play against the computer. 
Usual BlackJack rules apply: whoever reaches 21 first, or gets closest to 21 wins. 

If you go over 21 you "bust" and lose automatically.

An ace can count as either 1 or 11; up to the player's discretion.


Have fun :)
